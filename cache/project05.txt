5. (Optional) Additional Comments:

Overall project was not too difficult. The hardest part was understanding what
the commands for each line meant, like "I" "M" ...

Other than that, the overall concept and setup of the project was not too bad.
The only reason we spent an excessive amount of time on this project was
because we were having valgrinds errors that we couldnt resolve easily. The
program ran fine and took us about 12-13 hours to do. The other hours were
spent ridding the code of valgrinds errors
